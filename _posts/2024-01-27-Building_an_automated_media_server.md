This is a quick and easy way to install all the Arrs (prowlarr,radarr,sonarr,lidarr,jellyfin,readarr,bazarr,sabnzbd,qbittorrent,nzbhydra,usenet,homarr) and automate your media server on ubuntu at home.

I wrote this basic bash script to install all of these for a friend.

This is based on multiple sources - Credits to Trashguides, wiki.Servarr, awesomeopensource and ibracorp yt channels.

This is how the dashboard looks with all of the above configured.
